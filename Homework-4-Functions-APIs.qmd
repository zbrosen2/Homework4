## Task 1: Conceptual Questions
### Question 1
lapply() applies a function to each element of a vector or list. The equivalent purrr function is map().

### Question 2
```{r}
#| eval: false
lapply(my_list, FUN = function(df) {
                  cor(df, method = "kendall")
                })
```

### Question 3
purrr functions give a shorthand way to make anonymous functions. purrr gives a bit cleaner / more consistent way to apply functions to objects, especially when using tidyverse (it includes lots of additional helper functions).

### Question 4
A side-effect function modifies something outside the function, but doesn't necessarily automatically return the data as well.

### Question 5
When you call a function, it creates temporary function environments. R uses lexical scoping, so when you create a new variable like 'sd' in a function, it doesn't overwrite the sd function.
